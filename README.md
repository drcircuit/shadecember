## Overview

Welcome to the "24 Shaders Until Christmas" repository! This project consists of a series of WebGL fragment shaders written using the GLSL language. Each day leading up to Christmas, a new shader is added to create a visually stunning advent calendar of shader art. The shaders are implemented with the help of the DrCiRCUiTs Canvas Library, providing a framework for web graphcis development.
